### Hey, I’m Jenil 👋

#### Focused on building tools that remove friction and reveal intent.

Building Devsecrin — a high-context RAG engine for developers.<br>
Currently chasing systems that think, code that explains itself, and tools that *don’t get in the way*.

---

- 🚀 Working on: `DevSecrin` — A developer context engine powered by Git + Docs + Tickets + AI.
- 🧠 Exploring: system design, local-first tools, AI memory, graph-based knowledge models
- ⚒️ Daily stack: `.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, `.sql`, `.md`, `.json`, `.sh`
- 🕸️ Fan of modular systems, Swiss design principles, and calm infrastructure
- 🧭 Mission: Build tools that *amplify developers*, not just assist them
- 💬 Ping me about **developer productivity**, **tooling design**, **AI + code**, **graph embeddings**, **RAG**, or **system design**
