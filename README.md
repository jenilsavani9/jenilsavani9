### Hey, I’m Jenil

#### Focused on building tools that remove friction and reveal intent.

Building Secrin, a high-context RAG engine for developers.<br>
Currently chasing systems that think, code that explains itself, and tools that *don’t get in the way*.

---

- Working on: `Secrin`, A developer context engine powered by Git + Docs + Tickets + AI.
- Exploring: system design, local-first tools, AI memory, graph-based knowledge models
- Daily stack: `.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, `.sql`, `.md`, `.json`, `.sh`
- Mission: Build tools that *amplify developers*, not just assist them
- Ping me about **developer productivity**, **tooling design**, **AI + code**, **graph embeddings**, **RAG**, or **system design**
